      <h1>Campaign Statement</h1>
      <p>Our aim with this campaign is to eliminate the precedents and stigmas generated by the growing partisan divide in the United States. We as a country have grown to find simple, concrete answers to complex problems, while also abiding by our partisan beliefs, making partisanship more of an obstacle than a solution. Our campaign is not partisan. It is focused on fulfilling the American promise that has been impeded by ideological arguments instead of ideological compromise. We as a country must be comfortable in solutions that do not entirely agree with our beliefs because not one frame of mind is entirely correct. The inclusion of many perspectives and ideas into a decision can only bring about the best possible conclusion. Only when we hear the other side can we understand ourselves and our circumstances. Only then can we grow and strengthen as a country.</p>
